Education
======
* B.S. in Applied Math & Physics, University of South Florida, 2026 (Expected)

Work experience
======
* *Jun 2025 - Aug 2025*: **Merck (Boston, MA)** - Modeling & Informatics Intern 
  * Incorporated physics-based method SchrÂ¨odinger BioLuminate and custom predictive models into
PepINVENT to optimize binding affinity, potency, and ADME properties in peptide design
  * Fine-tuned peptide language model PeptideCLM for enhanced ADME prediction and descriptorbased model CheMeleon for improved potency prediction, exceeding internal benchmarks.
  * Enhanced PepINVENT with a multi-agent framework that can learn the most impactful residue
positions to optimize and outperforms the original version in multi-parameter peptide optimization.
  *  Enabled pretraining of PepINVENT on internal cyclic peptide data for a production-ready model
by developing an algorithm to convert HELM sequences into structured data and expand datasets
through synthetic generation and augmentation.
